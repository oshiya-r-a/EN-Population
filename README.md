# Role of Electronegativity on the Elemental Diversity in High Entropy Alloys
The code for data extraction, population analysis, and the calculation of the average EN difference for an n-component alloy is included in the file HEA_Population_EN.ipynb. As an example, the code demonstrates these processes specifically for the hydrogen (H) atom. To perform these analyses for other elements, simply replace 'H' with the desired element's name.
